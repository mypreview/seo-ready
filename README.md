## Description

When it comes to SEO there are a lot of things you need to consider to keep your website up to date. This plugin aims to help you with the technical side of On-Page SEO and provides a graphical user interface to generate a set of most commonly used meta tags, in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee.

*Even though the term “tag” is not 100% correct in many places (some tags should correctly be called “elements” or “attributes”), people use this term because they tend to look for tags rather than the correct technical terms.*
