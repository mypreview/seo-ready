## Schema Markup
Optimize the way search engines understand and display your content. Selecting relevant schema types will improve how pages and posts are interpreted and make them more likely to display in rich snippets, potentially increasing visibility in search results. The article type dropdown menu will also allow you to customize the schema settings based on the content, thus properly presenting the content in the search engine listings.

## Social Media Integration
Control over how the content appears on platforms like Facebook and Twitter/X, including what images, titles, and descriptions to use ensures posts look their best when shared, captures attention and generates engagement.

## Breadcrumbs Block
The schema-enhanced Breadcrumbs block helps boost both user navigation and SEO. Breadcrumbs not only help users understand their location on a site but also provide search engines with valuable context.
The Breadcrumbs block settings will allow you to personalize the delimiter, hide the current page title, hide or override site title (e.g., change it to "Home"), and customize the block styles with tweaking typography, padding, margin, and color to seamlessly blend with your site’s design.
